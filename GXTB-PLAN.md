# g-xTB in this fork: the plan

This is `richapma78/tblite`, branch `gxtb` — **our own implementation of g-xTB inside tblite**,
the same host the method's authors chose (their implementation lives in a *private* tblite fork;
this is the public-side twin). The point of doing it here rather than anywhere else: the day the
authors publish their tblite g-xTB, reconciling is a `git merge`/file diff inside one codebase,
not a rewrite.

## What we have that makes this fully specified

1. **Equations, complete** — the g-xTB preprint SI (ChemRxiv 2025-bjxvt, in the consuming repo's
   `reference/`) derives every energy term AND the analytic gradients.
2. **Parameters, public at v1** — `param/gxtb/` in this repo carries the parameter files from the
   `grimme-lab/g-xtb` **v1.1.0 release** (2025-08-12, the latest public set; sha256 pinned in
   `SHA256SUMS`): `gxtb_parameters` (global + element-wise), `basisq` (the q-vSZP adaptive basis —
   per shell: exponents with a static and a charge-scaling contraction column), `eeq` (the charge
   model). Same license family as this codebase (LGPL-3.0).
3. **A bit-exact oracle** — the standalone v1.1 `gxtb` binary *reads these exact files* (installed
   at `/opt/gxtb-v1` in WSL; verified working: water total −76.43743981 Eh) and prints the energy
   **decomposed by term** (electronic / atomic core increments / dispersion / nuclear repulsion),
   so every term we implement is checkable in isolation, not just the total.
4. **An acceptance instrument** — the ChemRoutes Phase-1 harness (42 frozen-geometry probes, each
   isolating one physical term, with GFN2/g-xTB-v2/DFT labels in a results DB and an
   ordering-gate comparator).

## The terms to implement (SI structure, target file layout)

Mirroring the sibling files here (`src/tblite/xtb/gfn2.f90` etc.) and the layout the private fork's
binary reveals in its strings (`src/tblite/basis/q-vszp.f90`):

- `src/tblite/basis/q-vszp.f90` — the charge-adaptive basis: EEQ(BC) charges computed once per
  geometry, contraction coefficients c = c0 + c1·q, then a standard integral pass.
- `src/tblite/xtb/gxtb.f90` — the Hamiltonian: extended Hückel-type core with the SI's
  distance/CN-dependent scaling, **fourth-order** charge self-consistency (vs GFN2's third),
  Mulliken-approximated range-separated exchange, atomic correction potentials (ACPs; f-projectors
  on the heavy blocks), spin polarization constants, atomic core increments (these put totals on
  the all-electron wB97M-V/def2-TZVPPD absolute scale — the v1 oracle prints them separately).
- dispersion: revD4 (upstream tblite already carries D4 machinery to extend).

## Gates (declared before the build, per the consuming repo's discipline)

- **G1**: parse `param/gxtb/*` and reproduce the v1.1 oracle's *term decomposition* on water to
  1e-6 Eh per term.
- **G2**: reproduce the oracle's totals across the 42 harness probes (bit-tight target; declare
  the tolerance before running, fail = find the bug, never tune).
- **G3**: only after G2 — distill the parameter file toward the **v2** binary on harness probes
  (start from v1 values; this is fitting, not reverse engineering). The harness ordering gates
  (acyl ladder, Pd ladder) must stay MATCH throughout.
- **Merge day**: when upstream publishes g-xTB, diff/merge their implementation against this
  branch; whichever survives, the harness gates decide equivalence.

## Consumers

- The ChemRoutes sandbox dispatcher (`sandbox/qm.py`) already has the seam: its tblite backend
  takes the method as a string — this fork's build adding `"g-xTB"` makes it available with no
  caller changes.
- xtb consumes tblite as a meson subproject (`subprojects/tblite.wrap`); pointing the wrap at this
  fork yields a full xtb binary carrying our g-xTB, exactly how the authors' distribution works.
- A later GPU port (PySCF/CuPy batch-across-candidates) validates against this implementation via
  the same harness.
